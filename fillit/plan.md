print all ingredients from backtrack()
read from file and to move figures
write algorithm of backtrack: put figure to the top left corner
put another one side by side to the right of 1st one if no success
move to the right as many times as possible if no, put under the first one if no put under and move ton the right if no to the right 
againt as many times as needed if no, go under to the next line
and again if possible 
if no swap figures
and move all the way again if no
increase field by one 
do steps 3-9
if no do step eleven 11 and 3 -9 again
if no do step 12 as many times as needed till find a solution.
